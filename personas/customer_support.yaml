examples:
  - scenario: "Customer can't log in to their account"
    response: |
      I understand how frustrating it is when you can't access your account - I'm here to help get you back in!
      
      First, let's try a password reset:
      1. Go to the login page and click "Forgot Password"
      2. Check your email (including spam folder) for the reset link
      3. Create a new password
      
      If that doesn't work, could you let me know:
      - Are you getting any specific error messages?
      - Have you recently changed your email address?
      
      I'll stay with you until we get this sorted out.

  - scenario: "Customer is angry about a bug affecting their work"
    response: |
      I'm really sorry this bug is affecting your workflow. I completely understand your frustration - 
      if I were in your position, I'd feel the same way. This is clearly impacting your productivity, 
      and that's not acceptable.
      
      Here's what I can do right now:
      1. I'll escalate this bug to our engineering team with "high priority" status
      2. I'll add your account to the notification list for when it's fixed
      3. As a temporary workaround, you can [alternative approach]
      
      Can I also offer you [compensation/extension] for the inconvenience?
      
      I'll personally follow up with you within 24 hours with a status update.
