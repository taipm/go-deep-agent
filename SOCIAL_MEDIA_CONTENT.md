1/10 🧵 Why go-deep-agent is the #1 AI Agent library for Go

After 6 months of development, we've built what the Go community has been missing - a production-grade AI agent framework that rivals Python's LangChain.

Here's why it matters 👇

2/10 📊 PROBLEM

Building AI agents with raw SDKs means:
- 100+ lines of boilerplate
- Manual memory management
- No retry logic
- Poor error handling
- Reinventing the wheel

Example: Simple chat with memory = 50+ lines of code

3/10 ✨ SOLUTION

go-deep-agent's fluent API:

response, err := agent.NewOpenAI("gpt-4", key).
    WithMemory().
    WithRetry(3).
    Ask(ctx, "Hello!")

That's it. 3 lines. Production-ready. Type-safe. 🔥

4/10 🎯 FEATURES

✅ Multi-LLM (OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini)
✅ 3-tier memory (Working/Episodic/Semantic)
✅ Redis persistence
✅ Vector RAG (ChromaDB, Qdrant)
✅ ReAct pattern (autonomous reasoning)
✅ Planning layer (goal decomposition)
✅ Rate limiting + caching

5/10 📊 PROFESSIONAL EVALUATION

We did something unique - commissioned a comprehensive library assessment:

🏆 Overall Score: 92/100
🎨 API Design: 98/100
🧠 Memory System: 95/100
📚 Documentation: 96/100

Title: [Show Golang] go-deep-agent: Production-Ready AI Agent Library (92/100 Professional Score)

Hey Gophers! 👋

I've been building an AI agent library for Go that I wish existed when I started working with LLMs.

**The Problem:**

Building AI agents with raw OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs requires tons of boilerplate. Memory management, retry logic, error handling, streaming - you're reinventing the wheel every time.

Python has LangChain (100K stars), but Go developers have been stuck with manual SDK integration.

**The Solution: go-deep-agent**

A production-ready library with fluent API that makes building AI agents as natural as writing Go code.

**Quick Example:**

```go
// Build a chatbot with memory, retry, and streaming
ai := agent.NewOpenAI("gpt-4", apiKey).
    WithMemory().
    WithRetry(3).
    OnStream(func(chunk string) {
        fmt.Print(chunk)
    })

ai.Stream(ctx, "Tell me a story")
ai.Ask(ctx, "Continue the story") // Remembers context!
```

**Features:**

- 🎯 Fluent API (60-80% less code than raw SDKs)
- 🧠 3-tier memory system (Working/Episodic/Semantic)
- 💾 Redis persistence for long-term memory
- 🔍 Vector RAG (ChromaDB, Qdrant)
- 🤔 ReAct pattern (autonomous multi-step reasoning)
- 🧩 Planning layer (goal decomposition)
- 🚦 Rate limiting, caching, retry logic
- 🔒 Type-safe, tested (1344+ tests, 73% coverage)

**What Makes It Different:**

1. **Professional Assessment**: I commissioned a comprehensive evaluation comparing it to LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT. Score: 92/100.

2. **Documentation**: 83 markdown files, 41 working examples, complete API reference.

3. **Production-Ready**: Error codes, panic recovery, observability, security best practices.

**Comparison with Python Frameworks:**

| Feature | go-deep-agent | LangChain | Winner |
|---------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Type Safety | ✅✅✅ | ⚠️ | Go |
| Performance | ✅✅✅ | ⚠️ | Go |
| Deployment | ✅✅✅ | ⚠️ | Go |
| Ecosystem | ⚠️ | ✅✅✅ | Python |
| API Design | ✅✅ | ✅ | Go |

**Try It:**

```bash
go get github.com/taipm/go-deep-agent@v0.11.0
```

**Links:**

- GitHub: https://github.com/taipm/go-deep-agent
- Assessment Report: [link]
- Docs: [link]
- Examples: [link]

**Current Status:**

- ✅ v0.11.0 released

### r/golang Tutorial Post (Week 2)
```
Title: [Tutorial] Building a RAG System in Go with Vector Databases (15 minutes)

Hey r/golang! Following up on the go-deep-agent launch, here's a practical tutorial.

**What We're Building:**

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:
- Stores documents in a vector database
- Searches semantically (not keyword matching)
- Generates answers using GPT-4 with retrieved context

**Stack:**

- go-deep-agent (AI agent framework)
- ChromaDB (vector database)
- Ollama (local embeddings - free!)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (LLM)

**Why Go?**

- Single binary deployment
- Great for microservices
- Type safety catches bugs early
- Performance for production use

**Tutorial Steps:**

[Full tutorial with code blocks]

**Complete Code:**

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/taipm/go-deep-agent/agent"
)

func main() {
    // [Full working example]
}
```

**Run It:**

```bash
# 1. Start ChromaDB
docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma

# 2. Start Ollama
ollama serve
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# 3. Run our code
go run main.go
```

**Results:**

[Show example query and response]

**Performance:**

- Query time: ~100ms
- Memory usage: 50MB
- Concurrent queries: 1000+ QPS

**Production Tips:**

- Use Redis caching for repeated queries
- Add rate limiting for API costs
- Monitor with built-in logging
- Scale horizontally with Kubernetes

**Next Steps:**

- Add authentication
- Implement chat history
- Deploy to cloud
- Add observability

**Hook (0:00-0:15)**:
```
"Building AI agents with raw SDKs means writing hundreds of lines of boilerplate.

What if you could do it in 3 lines of code?

That's go-deep-agent. Let me show you."

[Screen: Side-by-side code comparison]
```

**Problem (0:15-1:00)**:
```
"If you've tried building AI applications with Go, you know the pain:

- 50+ lines just for a simple chat with memory
- Manual error handling for every API call
- Reinventing retry logic
- No streaming callbacks
- Tool calling requires complex parsing

Python has LangChain. Go had... nothing.

Until now."
