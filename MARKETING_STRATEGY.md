## 📧 OUTREACH EMAIL TEMPLATES

### For Go Influencers

**Subject**: Introducing go-deep-agent - Production-Ready AI Agents for Go

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I've built something the Go community has been missing: a production-ready AI agent library that makes building LLM applications as easy as writing regular Go code.

go-deep-agent just hit v0.11.0 with:
- Fluent API (60-80% less code than raw SDKs)
- 92/100 professional evaluation score
- 1344+ tests, 73%+ coverage
- Memory, RAG, ReAct patterns built-in

It's the first Go library to compete directly with Python's LangChain/CrewAI - but with Go's type safety, performance, and simplicity.

Would you be interested in:
- Featuring it in [GolangWeekly/your blog/your podcast]?
- A quick chat about the technical approach?
- Collaborating on a tutorial/comparison article?

GitHub: https://github.com/taipm/go-deep-agent
Assessment Report: [link to report]

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. The comparison with LangChain shows Go can be just as expressive as Python for AI work - maybe more so with compile-time guarantees!
```

### For Tech Publications

**Subject**: Story Pitch: "Go Takes on Python for AI Development"

```
Hi [Editor Name],

I have a story idea that challenges the "Python-only" narrative in AI development.

Angle: A new Go library (go-deep-agent) proves that type-safe, compiled languages can match Python's developer experience for AI agents - while offering better performance and production reliability.

Why now:
- Growing interest in Go for backend AI services
- Production concerns about Python AI apps (scaling, deployment, cost)
- First comprehensive professional evaluation of Go vs Python AI frameworks

Story includes:
- Side-by-side code comparisons
- Performance benchmarks
- Real-world production case studies
- Expert quotes from Go community leaders

Would this fit [Publication Name]'s coverage of AI/developer tools?

Happy to provide more details or an exclusive first look.

Best,
[Your Name]
```
