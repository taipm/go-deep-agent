## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO (Avoid 80% of Wasted Effort)

### ❌ LOW ROI Activities (Skip These Week 1)

1. **Creating Perfect Logo** (can use text logo)
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Impact: <5%
   - Do later: Week 2-3

2. **Building Project Website** (GitHub Pages is enough)
   - Time: 8 hours
   - Impact: <10%
   - Do later: Month 2

3. **Making Promotional Video** (text is enough initially)
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Impact: <10%
   - Do later: Week 3-4

4. **Email 20+ Influencers** (batch is inefficient)
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Impact: <5% (most ignore cold emails)
   - Do later: After you have traction

5. **Posting to 10+ Communities** (spam-like)
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Impact: Negative (looks desperate)
   - Do instead: Focus on 1-2 high-quality posts

---

## 🎯 THE LEAN PRINCIPLE

> **"Do less, but better."**

**Why r/golang + Dev.to + GitHub Topics?**

1. **r/golang**: Your exact audience, high conversion
2. **Dev.to**: SEO + evergreen content
3. **GitHub Topics**: Passive discovery

These 3 touch different acquisition channels:
- Community (Reddit)
- Content (Blog)
- Discovery (GitHub)

**Everything else is optimization, not core growth.**

---

## 🔄 AFTER WEEK 1: WHAT'S NEXT?

### If Successful (100+ stars):

**Double Down**:
- [ ] Write tutorial #1 (most requested topic from comments)
- [ ] Cross-post to r/programming (after 3 days)
- [ ] Submit to Hacker News (after momentum)

**Optimize**:
- [ ] Add demo GIF to README
- [ ] Improve docs based on questions
- [ ] Add "Built with go-deep-agent" section

### If Moderate (50-100 stars):

**Iterate**:
- [ ] Analyze: What did people like/dislike?
- [ ] Improve: Fix top pain points mentioned
- [ ] Retry: Different angle on r/golang (week 2)

### If Low (<50 stars):

**Pivot**:
- [ ] Ask: What's missing? (poll r/golang)
- [ ] Fix: Critical issues blocking adoption
- [ ] Relaunch: Different positioning

## 💡 THE SECRET SAUCE

### Why This Works:

1. **Reddit First**: Creates initial momentum
   - Upvotes signal social proof
   - Comments = engagement = GitHub stars
   - Viral potential = exponential growth

2. **Blog Second**: Captures search traffic
   - People searching "Go AI library"
   - Evergreen (keeps working forever)
   - Credibility builder

3. **GitHub Topics**: Passive discovery
   - People browsing GitHub topics
   - Zero effort after setup
   - Compounds over time

### The Flywheel:
```
Reddit → Stars → More visibility → More stars
   ↓
Blog → Search traffic → Stars → Better ranking
   ↓
Topics → Discovery → Stars → Trending
```

All three feed each other. **Start the flywheel with Reddit.**
